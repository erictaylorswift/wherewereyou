What did I know about preparing healthy meals to give me sustenance throughout the day, not to mention my brother who was 5? The thoughts I had were not thoughts any child should be exposed to: "My Mom can\'t care for me", "I\'m not worth the energy", "How do I even make my own lunch?", "There aren\'t enough groceries in the fridge to make something". You communicated a lot in that refusal of basic parental responsibilities - I don\'t even know if you know that. Now, as an adult, I do have more questions. Like, what were you filling your time with now that you saved 30 minutes per day on caring for your children?',
