I do not mean for my content to come off\n                as a pity party, but rather to shed light on the serious affects of mental illness. We need to start\n                recognizing these illnesses more and providing the support people and families need to navigate.\n                Otherwise, I fear, history will continue to repeat itself and the sins of the father (and mother) will\n                be placed on the children.</p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"col-6\">\n            <div class=\"card ml-5 mt-5 shadow\" style=\"max-width: 300px;\">\n                <img src=\"/assets/img/sad_clown_me.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"card-img\" style=\"max-width: 300px;\">\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>";
